💵 Robinhood Cash Delivery Simulation: Secure, Same-Day Delivery via Decentralized Supply Chain
"Secure, same-day cash delivery through a decentralized supply chain—modeled for Robinhood."

This project simulates a hypothetical same-day physical cash delivery system for Robinhood, reflecting a modern twist on traditional logistics within the fintech space. While digital currency and stablecoins dominate headlines, this concept explores how physical cash logistics can be modeled using supply chain principles and discrete event simulation.

🌐 **Project Overview**
This Arena simulation models how cash requests are:

Received by micro-hubs

Assigned to couriers

Verified via ID processes

Delivered successfully (or failed and audited)

The project includes:

A Connecticut-based micro-hub map

An Arena simulation model using Seize-Delay-Release, queues, and decision logic

Custom metrics and performance reporting

A bar chart of KPIs

Detailed supply chain logic integration

🗺️ **Micro-Hub Network Map (Connecticut)**
A digital map was created with 15 micro-hub locations across Connecticut, based on population density, simulating real-time cash access points.



⚙️** Arena Simulation Model: Entity Flow**
Key Modules
Cash Request: Entity creation simulating cash demand

Route to Nearest MicroHub: Processing delay representing routing

Assign Courier: Seize logic to allocate delivery personnel

Courier Pickup: Courier picks up cash for delivery

ID Verification & User Verification: Compliance checkpoints

Failed / Successful Deliveries: Process outcomes

Dispose: Clean exits from system

Queues & Animation
Visual queues added at "Assign Courier"

Icons used: person, box, courier, green/red markers

Simulation animation recorded with both logical and visual clarity

📊 **Simulation Results Summary**
Arena Output Report Summary:
Metric	Value
Total Requests Entered	120
Successful Deliveries	109
Failed Deliveries	3
Average Courier Utilization	0.13
Average WIP (In System)	1.45

📈 **Bar Graph of Key Metrics**


This clearly visualizes how successful deliveries dominated, courier utilization was low (indicating resource sufficiency), and failures were minimal.
